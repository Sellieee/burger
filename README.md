Eat-Da-Burger - a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. The burger is then placed in a list to be devoured. When the user clicks on the 'Devour it' button, the burger moves to the other side of the page. A database is used to store all the burgers listed, eaten or not.
